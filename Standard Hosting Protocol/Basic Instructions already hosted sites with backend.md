Let's assume project name is "My Project" with the domain name: "myproject.com" and github repo: myproject.git

Frontend Setup
The frontend of My Project is built using React and can be deployed on a hosting service like Hostinger. Follow the steps below to set it up:

Steps to Prepare and Deploy Frontend
Clone the repository or Create a new GitHub Codespace:

git clone https://github.com/SwastikChamp2/myproject.git
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd myproject/frontend
Install all required dependencies:

npm install
Build the production-ready files:

npm run build
Download the build folder generated in the frontend directory.

Log in to the Hostinger account:

Go to the Websites section.
Select your domain and open the Dashboard.
Navigate to File Manager and locate the public_html directory.
Upload the contents of the build folder to the public_html directory.

Deployment Instructions
Frontend Deployment
Follow the steps in the Frontend Setup section to build and deploy your React application.
Ensure the frontend URL in your backend .env file matches your deployed frontend URL.
Backend Deployment
The backend is already hosted on Vercel at https://myproject.vercel.app.
If changes are needed, push the updates to the backend directory, and Vercel will automatically handle the deployment.
Notes
Ensure your environment variables are secure and not exposed in the public repository.
For any issues during deployment, refer to the documentation of the respective services:
Hostinger Documentation
Vercel Documentation
Happy Coding!
